# Simple Blockchain Implementation in JavaScript

This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain written in JavaScript. The code demonstrates key blockchain concepts such as block creation, proof of work, and chain validation.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: Create new blocks with specific data.
- **Proof of Work**: Implement a basic proof of work algorithm.
- **Chain Validation**: Ensure the integrity of the blockchain by validating the entire chain.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/safhiHALIM/Blockchain.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Blockchain/blockchainn
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the blockchain script, use the following command:

```bash
node block.js
```

This will execute the script and demonstrate the creation of a blockchain, adding blocks, and validating the chain.

## Code Overview

### Block Class

The `Block` class defines a single block in the blockchain. Each block contains:

- `index`: The position of the block in the blockchain.
- `timestamp`: The time when the block was created.
- `data`: The data contained in the block.
- `previousHash`: The hash of the previous block in the chain.
- `hash`: The hash of the current block.
- `nonce`: A number used for the proof of work.

### Blockchain Class

The `Blockchain` class defines the blockchain itself. It includes methods for:

- Initializing the blockchain with a genesis block.
- Adding new blocks to the chain.
- Validating the integrity of the blockchain.

### Proof of Work

The proof of work algorithm ensures that the blockchain is secure. It involves finding a hash that meets certain criteria, requiring computational effort and making it difficult to tamper with the blockchain.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how the blockchain works:

```javascript
const { Blockchain, Block } = require('./block');

let myBlockchain = new Blockchain();
myBlockchain.addBlock(new Block(1, "10/07/2022", { amount: 4 }));
myBlockchain.addBlock(new Block(2, "12/07/2022", { amount: 10 }));

console.log(JSON.stringify(myBlockchain, null, 4));
console.log("Is blockchain valid? " + myBlockchain.isChainValid());
```
