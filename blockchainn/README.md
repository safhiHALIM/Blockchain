# A Very Simple Blockchain Example Implemented in TypeScript

This is an ordinary JavaScript repository, in which only a basic implementation of a blockchain has been made. Here, exemplary views of such important blockchain concepts as block creation, proof of work, and validating chains are presented.

## Features

- **Create Block**: a new block is created with some specifics of data.
- **Proof of Work**: Simple Proof of Work for the above purpose.
* **Chain Validation**: Move down all the chain, checking if everything makes sense as being correctâ€”move across to the other item.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on.

## Install the theme

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
In git clone, use:
HUMAN

2. Go to the project's directory:

```bash
cd Sample/blockchain
'''BN

3. Install dependencies if any

```bash
npm install
'''
human

## Use

To run the blockchain script, use this command:

Recall:
Block render_testing_block
'''
Mc

This executes the script, which demonstrates an example of the blockchain generation, the addition of a block, and verification of the chain.

## Overview of the code

### Block Class

Define what the`Block` class should be: Each the `Block` in a `BlockChain` should

- `index`: The position of the block in the blockchain.
- 'timestamp' : It states the date of creation of the block,.
- `data`: Data that the block contains.

- `previousHash`: Hash of the previous block in the chain.

- `hash`: hash of the block.
- `nonce`: A number used in proof of work.

### Class: Blockchain

```python

class Blockchain:

'''Building the Chain'''

To make human:

``fl

RTLU```

The genesis block of emission of an initialization block chain. Chain addition of blocks.

Verify the blockchain is complete.

Proof of Work

That's basically the hash that you're using as part of your proof of work algorithm, in that you need to make it strong. You'd be trying to come up with an appropriate hash, which is a pretty powerful computation and would make it hard to tamper with the blockchain.

## Example

This is a simple way of explaining how blockchain works:

```js

const { Blockchain } = require('./block');

Blockchain myBlockchain = new Blockchain();

myBlockchain.addBlock(new Block(1, "10/07/2022", { amount: 4 })); myBlockchain.addBlock(new Block(2, "12/07/2022", {amount:10})); console.log (JSON.stringify(my console.log( `Is blockchain valid?
